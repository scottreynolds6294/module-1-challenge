Horiseon Code Refactored
  This is the Module-1 challenge. The task was to refactor the source code to achieve several objectives. 
   Semantic elements were added to the HTML code.
   The HTML elements now follow a logical structure and code was consolidated to remove redundant code.
   Alt atributes were added to images.
   A title was added.
   Heading attributes were reordered to fall in sequential order.
   Links in the navigation bar are now all functional.
